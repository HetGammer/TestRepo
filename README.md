# Unity3D-Daily-Reward-System---Internet-Time

Set a Daily, hourly, by minutes, or even seconds reward system for your players to keep them coming back. Perfect for implementing reward video ads

A secure 24 hour timer is very important for your Unity3d Project. It is a fact that players enjoy coming back to a game simply for the daily rewards, but without a proper time system in place, you game can be easily hacked. If your daily or hourly reward system is checking the platform time, then all the player has to do is change the time of their computer or phone and “Tada!”. With a internet base time and date, you can create a daily events and rewards that is independent of the device time.
